Home Federal Savings Bank

In season 7, episode 24 of Seinfeld, Kramer visits a bank that promises to give $100 to anyone who isn’t greeted with a “hello.” Kramer is instead greeted with a “hey,” which he insists isn’t a “hello,” and so he asks for $100. The bank’s manager proposes a compromise: “You got a greeting that starts with an ‘h,’ how does $20 sound?” Kramer accepts.

In a file called bank.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output $0. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output $20. Otherwise, output $100. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.

How to Test
Here’s how to test your code manually:

Run your program with python bank.py. Type Hello and press Enter. Your program should output:
$0

$20
Run your program with python bank.py. Type What's happening? and press Enter. Your program should output
$100
You can execute the below to check your code using check50, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that check50 outputs to see the input check50 handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

How to Submit
In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.
